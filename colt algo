1. understand the problem
   1. can I restate the problem in my own words?
   2. what are the inputs that go into the problem?
   3. what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
   4. can the outputs be determined from the inputs? 
   in other words, do I have enough information to solve th problem?
   5. how should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the 
   problem?

2. explore concrete examples 
   Start with simple examples
   progress to more complex examples
   explore examples with empty inputs
   explore examples with invalid inputs
   
3. break it down
    do just a little comment as a guide for the steps I need to take in

4. solve/simplifyu
   find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
   temporarily ignore that difficulty
   write a simplified solution
   then incorporate that difficulty back in
   
5. look back and refactor
   can you check the result?
   can you derive the result differently?
   can you understand it at a glance?
   can you use the result or method for some other problem?
   can you improve the performance of your solution?
   can you think of other ways to refactor?
   how have other people solved this problem?
